			<h3>About!</h3>
		<p>				The English setter is a very athletic dog with the endurance to run tirelessly at a good pace. This dog is eye catching because of its beautiful coat and lively tail. The coat is flat, with feathering on the ears, underside, legs and tail. Its markings are very distinctive consisting of flecks of color and spots. The combination of good looks and hunting ability makes the English setter a perfect hunting companion. These dogs were bred to have a plentiful supply of endurance to cover a lot of area when hunting. The English setter is a lively dog that loves to run and hunt!

			<h5>Is it right for you?</h5>
			<p2>The English setter is an incredibly athletic dog that needs exercise very often and in order to do that; you will either need to walk your dog regularly, or have a big enough yard for it to roam. Without the appropriate exercise your English Setter will become rowdy and even tear up your house! If given the appropriate amount of exercise it is a fairly calm dog. So grab your leashes and take your Setter for a walk or a hunting trip!</p2>
